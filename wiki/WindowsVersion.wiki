= Windows Setup =

_FreeSpeech Windows install is in development. Here is what we have so far, if you want to help._

== Dev Preparation ==

    # Make a c:\Dev folder
    # Make a GTK folder inside that
    # Put everything inside that

=== Install Python ===

64 bit Python will not work for this. I tried it.

    # Get python-2.7.3 32 bit from http://www.python.org/getit/
    # Install to C:\Dev\Python27
    # take a break while waiting for that to install

=== Install GTK+ ===

    * Read instructions on http://www.gtk.org/download/win64.php
    * Open up the README that you just extracted.
    * Verify that their instructions agree with ours.

=== Add System Paths ===

    # Open up My Computer->Properties->Advanced System Settings->Environment Variables
    # Scroll down to Path
    # Double-click it
    # Append the install paths:
    # ;C:\Dev\GTK\bin;C:\Dev\Python27 to the end of the Path system variable
    # Ok OK OK
    # You will probably have to reboot or log out and back in for the path to take effect.

=== Install PyGTK ===

Install pygtk-all-in-one-2.24.2.win32-py2.7.msi from http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/binaries/win32/pygtk/2.24/

Test the installation
Open a terminal: Start Menu->"type in 'cmd'"->Enter
{{{
python
import gtk
window=gtk.Window()
window.show
}}}

== Gstreamer for Windows ==

Install:
    * GStreamer-WinBuilds-LGPL-x86-Beta04-0.10.7
    * GStreamer-WinBuilds-SDK-LGPL-x86-Beta04-0.10.7
Get them from http://code.google.com/p/ossbuild/

Copy contents of:
{{{
C:\Program Files (x86)\OSSBuild\GStreamer\v0.10.7\sdk\bindings\python\v2.7\lib\site-packages
}}}
to:
{{{
C:\Program Files (x86)\OSSBuild\GStreamer\v0.10.7\lib\site-packages
}}}
Reboot or log out / in

== PocketSphinx ==

*This is the point where we are stuck.* Gstreamer can't find the pocketsphinx audio plugin. According to http://cmusphinx.sourceforge.net/wiki/gstreamer the gstreamer pocketsphinx-plugin should be included, since Version 0.5. Maybe the installer put in the wrong GST_PLUGIN_PATH or maybe we need to set a different LD_LIBRARY_PATH? Running gst-inspect fails to find the plugin. Refer to http://cmusphinx.sourceforge.net/wiki/gstreamer

Another option is _compiling pocketsphinx from svn_.

    # <strike>Get from http://sourceforge.net/projects/cmusphinx/files/pocketsphinx/0.8/pocketsphinx-0.8-win32.zip/download</strike>
    # Pocketsphinx needs MSVCR100.dll which you can get from MS Visual Studio 2010, Visual C++ 2010 Express (for programmers) or vcredist (32bit) (for users) at http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/confirmation.aspx?id=14632

= Windows Setup =

== Dev Preparation ==

    # Make a c:\Dev folder
    # Make a GTK folder inside that
    # Put everything inside that

=== Install Python ===

64 Python will not work for this. I tried it.

    # Get python-2.7.3 32 bit from http://www.python.org/getit/
    # Install to C:\Dev\Python27
    # take a break while waiting for that to install

=== Install GTK+ ===

    * Read instructions on http://www.gtk.org/download/win64.php
    * They should say to download GTK+ bundle from http://www.gtk.org/download/win64.php

    * Open up the README that you just extracted.
    * Verify that their installation instructions agree with ours.

=== Add System Paths ===

    # Open up My Computer->Properties->Advanced System Settings->Environment Variables
    # Scroll down to Path
    # Double-click it
    # Append the install paths:
    # ;C:\Dev\GTK\bin;C:\Dev\Python27 to the end of the Path system variable
    # Ok OK OK
    # You will probably have to reboot or log out and back in for the path to take effect.

=== Install PyGTK ===

    # Install pygtk-all-in-one-2.24.2.win32-py2.7.msi
    # from http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/binaries/win32/pygtk/2.24/
    # take a break

Test the installation
Open a terminal: Start Menu->"type in 'cmd'"->Enter
{{{
python
import gtk
window=gtk.Window()
window.show
}}}
OK that was a lame test, but it worked, didn't it?

== PocketSphinx ==

    # Get from http://sourceforge.net/projects/cmusphinx/files/pocketsphinx/0.8/pocketsphinx-0.8-win32.zip/download
    # Pocketsphinx needs MSVCR100.dll which you can get from MS Visual Studio 2010, Visual C++ 2010 Express (for programmers) or vcredist (32bit) (for users) at http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/confirmation.aspx?id=14632

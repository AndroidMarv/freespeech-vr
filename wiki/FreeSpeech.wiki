== About ==

FreeSpeech is a real-time voice recognition application for the desktop (Android soon, hopefully). Offline speaker-independent voice recognition with dynamic language learning capability. 

== Requirements ==

The following packages should be installed.

  * [http://www.python.org/ Python 2.7]
  * [http://www.pygtk.org/ pygtk2]
  * [http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/ gstreamer, including gstreamer-python]
  * [http://cmusphinx.sourceforge.net/ pocketsphinx]
  * [http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/SLM/toolkit_documentation.html CMU-Cambridge Statistical Language Modeling Toolkit v2]

== Improving accuracy  ==

The biggest improvements in accuracy have been achieved by adjusting the microphone position. The volume level is adjusted automatically and tweaking it is not likely to improve much. You may try making a recording with [http://audacity.sourceforge.net Audacity] and checking the noise levels to make sure it sounds like intelligible speech when played back.

The language model that ships with this download, "freespeech.ref.txt" is likely to be very limited. Our excuse is that being pared-down as it is will save memory while providing room to more easily learn your manner of speaking. Don't be surprised if it does not work very well for you at first. Use the keyboard to manually edit the text in the box until it says what you intended to say. Then hit the "Learn" button. It will try to do better at understanding you next time!

The language model may be further [http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/SLM/toolkit_documentation.html#evallm tweaked and improved].

If there is a word that it stubbornly refuses to recognize, even after using it in several sentences, you may need to edit the dictionary: "freespeech.dic"
